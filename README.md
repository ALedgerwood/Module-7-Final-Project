# Module-7-Final-Project
working through a spacy tutorial to learn NLP and apply it to a poem

Tutorial from RealPython https://realpython.com/natural-language-processing-spacy-python/

Poem "The Hilly We Climb" by Amanda Gorman https://readingwise.com/assets/uploads/pdf/The_Hill_We_Climb_Transcript.pdf

Learning Outcomes:
I worked through the tutorial steps, adding explanatory markdown.
I was able to extract the text of the poem from a pdf.
I used the steps from the tutorial to remove stop words, lemmatize the poem, look at the five most common words, and look at jsut the adjectives using POS tagging.
